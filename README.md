# Roadmap

1. Build a tokenizer.
2. To be able to feed the ai with as much information as possible - I will stick to most common words in a review.
    So that's part of preprocessing in training. But this means I can insert more reviews per prompt.
3. The tokenizer will also have special tokens to support the prompt's structure.
4. Then I will train the model.

Once I know how many tokenizers I need, I can choose the model I need to run it.
